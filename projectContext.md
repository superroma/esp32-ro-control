ESP32-Based RO Water Monitor with HomeKit + OLED

This project uses an ESP32 DevKit to monitor a reverse osmosis (RO) water filtration system, track water usage via a flow sensor, and display key information on a 0.96" I2C OLED screen. It integrates natively with Apple HomeKit using HomeSpan library to provide real-time filter status monitoring, maintenance notifications, and Siri control without requiring any additional hubs or bridges.

## Project Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL with Native HomeKit Integration

The system is now complete with full WiFi configuration, OLED display navigation, and native HomeKit integration featuring 6 accessories (5 filters + water usage sensor) accessible via iOS Home app with Siri control and automation support.

## Hardware Components

- ESP-WROOM-32 DevKit (Wi-Fi microcontroller, 520KB RAM, 4MB Flash)
- SSD1306 OLED display (128x64, I2C) - pins 21 (SDA), 22 (SCL)
- Two push buttons for navigation:
  - Left button (GPIO 0) - Previous screen
  - Right button (GPIO 2) - Next screen
- Flow meter (e.g. YF-S201) for water usage tracking (planned)
- Optional: TDS sensors for water quality monitoring

## Software Architecture

- **Display System**: Multi-screen interface with 7 normal screens (dashboard + individual filter screens + usage)
- **Navigation System**: Dual-button control with left/right navigation and auto-rotation
- **Counter Reset Feature**: Hold both buttons for 3 seconds to access special reset screen

## HomeKit Integration Strategy

Using **HomeSpan** library for native HomeKit integration:

- **Direct HomeKit Protocol** - no additional hubs, bridges, or MQTT brokers required
- **Custom HomeKit Accessories** - each filter as FilterMaintenance service with percentage remaining
- **HomeKit Services**: Water usage sensor, leak detection, system status notifications
- **Setup Process**: WiFi configuration ‚Üí HomeKit pairing (setup code displayed on OLED)
